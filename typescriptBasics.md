# The Basics of TypeScript

## The Foundations of TypeScript
The foundation of TypeScript is JavaScript - a language that makes web pages more interactive. Any modern website will utilise some amount of JavaScript. Furthermore, the more complex the site; the more complex the JavaScript. 

JavaScript, however, was not built fo building complex systems.

## The Beginnings of TypeScript

Developers started looking for a betetr way to write JavaScript.  

Around 2010, Microsoft noticed that a lot of their teams were using a community project called Script# (ScriptSharp) to build their JavaScript apps. This library allowed developers to write code in C#, and then turn it to JavaScript. C# had excellent features for building large applications - so it made the experience of building these apps more pleasant. In fact, many teams had found this was the only way they could build complex applications in large teams. Anders Hejlsberg, the creator of C#, was tasked to investigate this phenomenon...

People were so annoyed with JavaScript that they were willing to code in a completely different language in order to get the powerful IDE (integrated development environment) features they were used to.

He create a new language that was closer to JavaScript. One that enabled all of the IDE features that JAvaScript was missing - TypeScript was born. It is now a staple of modern development. In many metrics, it is even more popular than JavaScript. 

## How TypeScript Works

In typeScript, the code is primarily inside a `.ts` file
